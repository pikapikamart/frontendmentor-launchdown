## My process

Hello, this is my 18th challenge here in FEM. Almost been months since I posted my last solution in FEM, I have been studying a lot of frontend/backend with just myself and creating different web application which I designed so that I could enhance as well my designing skills. This is really important because you should be building up this knowledge with all things doing by yourself. FEM has been a great support for me and I can't thank it enough^^. This challenge was really fun because of the flipping animation and using different 3d-ish css. I am really happy if you liked it ^^

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- FlexBox
- Grid
- Sass preprocessor

I said that I won't use any frameworks and build it from scratch to be more exciting and challenging

### What I learned

I learned in this project that animations can be quite a tricky but manageable. Though I really want to support accessibility in here, but really hard for me to maket this one. I supposed this is really a challenge for just visual. But I am now always trying to practice accessibility and I am really proud of it^^.

### Continued development

I want to focus more on creating more complex designs and also designing things on my own time
